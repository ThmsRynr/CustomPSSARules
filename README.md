# Thomas Rayner's Custom PSScriptAnalyzer Rules
This is a collection of random PSSA rules I sometimes use in my projects. Some are better documented and tested than others. 

They don't all belong in a production environment either. Test-AvoidGet.psm1, for instance, throws warnings if you use the Get verb. Obviously that's just for demo purposes when you want to display a false positive or play around with violations in a good script.
